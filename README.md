# Splines

Algorithm for finding the minimal distance between two parametric cubic splines and their intersection point if it exists

## Description
1. Parametrically constructs two cubic splines with defect 1 at the given points. 
2. Finds the point of intersection of two splines.
3. Determines the shortest distance between two splines if the splines do not intersect.
